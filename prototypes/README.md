# Prototypes

To start a prototype:
 
- Make sure you have nodejs
- You can install multiple node version with https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
- Use node version 13
- Navigate to the prototype folder eg: harp.gl-01 and run `npm install`
- My personal token was mapped to here.danielbeeke.nl because of that I have an entry in my /etc/hosts: 127.0.0.1 here.danielbeeke.nl
- I don't know how to have a token that is allowed on localhost
- Create a file in the root of the prototype called `config.ts` with the contents: `export const token = 'your-token';`
- Run `npm start`
